====

GH3+ is a work in progress plugin system for Guitar Hero III written in C++.

Latest release
--------------

The most recent unofficial release in progress is v0.6f. This release contains:
- core
- AlwaysDoubleNotes
- ForceStrumNotes
- ForceTapNotes
- GemShuffle
- Speedhack
- Logger
- MirrorMode
- NoteLimitFix
- TapHopoChord
- TextureHelper
- TiltFix
- WhammyFix
- Windowed mode

Coming soon:
- MuhZones
- RichPresence
- Modifiers (to merge some of the plugins above, easen changing which mods the player wants enabled)
- Script executor (hopefully)
- unAspyring (patches to bring the "better" experience from Xbox and PS3, might not really do)

Apparently not soon or then:
- HelgaBot (Exile said himself he's not releasing it as a way to thwart cheaters)
- GemLimitFix <sub>(assumed to be sprite limit fix)</sub>

Changes from the latest version include:
- Major updates to the GH3+ API, supporting most of GH3's native "Qb" structures/classes.
- RUNNING ON A BETTER NO-CD EXE (cut down file size, better deobfuscated SecuROM)
- Open notes
